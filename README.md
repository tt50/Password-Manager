# Password Manager
Password Manager Application 

# Note
I worked on this group project while taking the course Software Design at Temple University with the members listed below. This forked verison includes my own changes/improvements on the user interface and project overall.

# Description
Users will be able to create their own Password Manager accounts and will have a dashboard displaying stored User credentials. Usernames, associated user platform or nickname, will be displayed on the dashboard and passwords hidden, which can be revealed with a button click. Additional features on the dashboard will include a Password Generator to generate strong random passwords, and a Password Strength checker to evaluate security of usersâ€™ passwords.
